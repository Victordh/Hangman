Hangman game - This app picks a random word from a dictionary. The user guesses
letters that might occur in this word. If a letter does occur, the computer will
show any occurances of that letter. If it doesn't, the player loses one chance
(out of 6). At the bottom, there is a list of already guessed letters, correct
and incorrect. The player can (re)start the game with the 'New word' button.
